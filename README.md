# Brick-breaker-game
a simple brick breaker game developed in python.
in this game, you have a paddle and a ball where you bounce the ball from the paddle onto the bricks to break them.
once you fail to hit the ball and you miss(making it fall under the paddle), you lose and one life out of three is taken from you.
if you are able to hit all the bricks without losing all your lives, you are declared a winner and the reverse is true.
